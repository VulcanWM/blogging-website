I have continued using the *next.js official tutorial* to make this brilliant blog website!

I have customised the content to make it my own and will now work on deploying it.

**The next.js documentation is awesome**

My Coding To Do List:
- Finish this website
- Make my own project using Next.js
- Make the same project in Flask
- Compare the two projects
- Make a blog on it!
